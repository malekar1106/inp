    <h1>Green Space</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>"A place covered with greenery all around. You have trees on both side of the road that gives a pleasant feeling while you take a break and simply live in the present by reconnecting with the nature. It is indeed true that nature always heals us with its delicate beauty and stillness that remains constant no matter what the changes. With seasons passing by and leaves wilting off the trees, its always a best choice to take a morning or an evening stroll in this place."</p>
